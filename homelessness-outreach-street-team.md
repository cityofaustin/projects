The Homelessness Outreach Street Team (HOST) represents a new collaborative initiative in Austin’s Central Business District to address proactively the needs of people living on the streets.  HOST brings together the expertise of police officers, behavioral health specialists, a paramedic, and outreach social workers. This multidisciplinary team will help bridge the gaps between social services and public safety where hard-to-reach populations get stuck in the revolving door of emergency shelters, justice systems, and emergency services.

Modeled after similar successful homeless outreach programs in other cities across the U.S., HOST will proactively deploy on the streets. The Austin Police Department (APD), Austin-Travis County Integral Care (ATCIC), Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and Downtown Austin Alliance are sponsoring HOST within existing resources to test the effectiveness of the approach.

The original test project ran from June 1 through September 30, 2016 within boundaries of the Colorado River, Lamar Blvd., 29th Street, and IH-35. At the end of September 2016, Austin City Council allocated funds to extend the initiative for an additional year of testing. During this time, team members patrol the test area daily to interact frequently with people living on the streets. They work to build trust, provide immediate aid when possible, and motivate and connect people with local service providers as quickly as possible. HOST will connect with Front Steps, Salvation Army, Caritas of Austin, Trinity Center and others who provide clients with essential emergency/social services, and the Ending Community Homelessness Coalition (ECHO) who provides permanent supportive housing through its local housing network.

Inter-agency and private sectors partners will gather experience and evidence during the pilot to inform and advise officials on whether to sustain the program long-term, and funding requirements to bolster-up critical gaps in the social service network in the FY-17 City and County budgets.
