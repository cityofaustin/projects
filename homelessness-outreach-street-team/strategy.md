HOST was designed to fit into and reinforce community commitment for Austin’s larger strategy of ending community homelessness.

In January 2017, Bloomberg Philanthropies awarded a grant to the City of Austin for the hire of an innovation team to support HOST's efforts. The innovation team will focus on data sharing and integration, service design, and shared reasoning around homelessness.
