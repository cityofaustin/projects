# Roadmap Layer: Teams

> *The unit of delivery is the team.* - [UK Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/26/what-weve-learnt-about-scaling-agile/)

When the City of Austin applied for the U.S. Department of Transportation Smart City Challenge in 2016, we had the best, most diverse, cross-disciplinary, cross-sector team imaginable. By all accounts, the work this team did to answer the call advanced our progress on Smart Cities by about 3-4 years. The secret sauce is the team.

## Agile

Self-organizing, cross-functional teams collaborate and plan adaptively, deliver early, while responding flexibly to change.

## Human-centered

Teams meaningfully include the community in the design, production, and delivery of public value; they design with, not for, the community.

## Iterative

Teams begin with discovery, and iterate through testing and experimentation: they prioritize efforts on problems worth solving, and opportunities worth seizing.

## Discovery phase feedback that led to this section

During and after the April 18, 2017 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked for advice from participants through an [insights campaign](http://insights.austintexas.gov/Austin/1001/insights). We learned:

> "The City needs to develop guidance to support prototyping and experimenting in an ethical and transparent way."

> "Investment in the right skillsets, diverse perspectives, and human capital for the City is critical to the success (and even initiation) of projects."

> "Effective solutions require that we support dedicated teams with diverse skillsets and backgrounds."

> "Contributors noted many considerations for managing Smart Cities as a program, including: goals, maturity, measures, value/cost drivers, critical infrastructure, and key resources."

> "Contributors said the city needs to enable a state of readiness for agile and iterative implementation of projects."

## Challenge areas identified

* How might we help smart city project teams work in agile, human-centered, and iterative ways?

* How might we help project teams connect with the expertise or perspectives they need, whether inside or outside the City government?

* How might we clarify ethics and standards for prototyping and testing?
