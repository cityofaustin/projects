## Principles

We kicked off the new year with a workshop to review our research and develop a set of principles to guide design decisions moving forward. These ten principles allow us to ask critical questions of our work.

**Accessible**

Provide information in an open and welcoming manner.

**Connective**

Develop resilient relationships between parties.

**Empowering**

Promote ownership of problems and solutions by city staff.

**Responsive**

Support change and meet arising needs.

**Spirited**

Foster alignment among city departments.

**Accountable**

Share responsibility and mutual support.

**Efficient For The User**

Facilitate a manageable experience for the public.

**Educational**

Share knowledge and promote understanding.

**Transparent**

Reveal the foundation that supports information.

**Intuitive**

Present inherently available tools and processes.

## Tracks

The Permitting Initiative

**The Web Resource Track** works to develop intuitive digital presentation of standards and rules for the city’s permitting process. An accessible resource for customers and employees will reinforce the permitting process and establish an educational framework to move projects forward.

**The Service Experience Track** co-creatively designs the customer and employee experiences, as well as the business processes required for responsible delivery of the permitting service. In-Person will enact, adapt, and streamline rules and resources for real-time interactions.

**The Alignment Track** is focused on helping the city achieve cohesion and alignment among departments implementing city code and permitting policies. By identifying collaborative opportunities to maintain a sustainable permitting process, the team will create a foundation for Web and Service design.

**The Communications Track** translates collaborative processes to daily project management. By designing a workflow for permitting services, the team will establish more comprehensive and accessible internal and external correspondence.
