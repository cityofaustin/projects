## Sprint 1 - Utility Assistance Service Mapping

For the first sprint, the team honed their process by mapping utility assistance services. Mounting utility bills are a well known cause of displacement pressure, and there are serveral programs that provide utility assitance. However, the team found that many of these programs have access issues, and may not function as intended.

The team will deliver the service insights to NHCD and program managers, and integrate them into future service design sprints. Sprint 2 will take on eviction data and home repair.
