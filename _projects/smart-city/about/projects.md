## Austin's smart city project inventory

As part of our smart city initiative, we are compiling a list of local projects that align with our [definition of "smart city"](/projects/smart-city/about/definition/) for Austin. In sharing and updating this list, we hope to:

- Bring more awareness to the kinds of technology projects Austin is investing in
- Make these projects more transparent and accessible
- Spark more engagement and collaboration on these efforts with the Austin community

### Update in progress -- more projects coming soon

We're updating this list in fall 2018, based on an [original list](https://airtable.com/embed/shrw1eaApYvCI2fbE/tbluO6vp5XB2GwYk4/viwPqpeM7kQ69dSC5) put together in 2017.
