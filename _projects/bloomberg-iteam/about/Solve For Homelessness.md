## [Solve For Homelessness](https://austininnovation.wixsite.com/solveforhomelessness)




Since September 2017, the Office of Innovation’s iTeam has worked with individuals and partners across the City of Austin to understand homelessness in Austin from the perspective of people living those experiences. We have also examined some of the public and non-profit response systems that are addressing this growing crisis.

Transparency. Education. Engagement.

This [website](https://austininnovation.wixsite.com/solveforhomelessness)has been created to share the iTeam’s processes and research, communicate what we learned, and provide up-to-date information about our recommendations and ongoing collaborative projects.
