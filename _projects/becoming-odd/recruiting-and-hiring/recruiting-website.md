## The first place to find us

When we launched our Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellows program in May 2016, we knew that we needed a stronger web presence for our program and its open positions than what was available to us on [austintexas.gov](http://austintexas.gov/) or [austincityjobs.org](https://www.austincityjobs.org/)

Folks in NYC had recently launched an open-source website called NYCTechJobs, so we decided to fork it both to save development time and to actively demonstrate the open-source values of our new program:

As our needs evolved, so did our recruiting website, and later in 2016 we forked the [US Digital Service website](http://usds.gov) for our next iteration:

A third iteration followed in Summer 2017 to match the styling of our other design elements:

Our most recent iteration is updated to introduce our new [Office of Design & Delivery](http://odd.austintexas.gov). It's also the first time that we feature our [Principles](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/becoming-odd/about/principles/) and [Values](http://projects.austintexas.io/projects/becoming-odd/about/values/), which are included in the "How we work" section of [odd.austintexas.io](http://odd.austintexas.io)
