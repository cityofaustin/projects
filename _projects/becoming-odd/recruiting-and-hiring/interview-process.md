## How we interview

We've refined the following process for screening, interviewing, and selecting candidates:

1. Minimum quality check
2. Tech screening
3. Phone screening
4. In-person interview
5. Reference checks
6. Offer

The following google doc walks through this process, with related documents for technical screenings and interview questions for six of our disciplines:
