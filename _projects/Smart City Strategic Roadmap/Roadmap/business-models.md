## Business Models

How we organize around key resources and activities that deliver a value proposition to city residents and customers, while balancing cost structures between private sector revenue streams and public sector financing sources.

## Government as a Platform

The idea of ["government as a platform"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000774/ch02.html) suggests that in addition to directly providing end-to-end services, government can provide data and technology open to others to deliver services themselves. What does City government need to do to establish itself as a platform and enabler of Smart Cities?

## Partnerships

What kind of public-private partnerships, strategic alliances, and programs (such as ["entrepreneurs in residence"](http://startupinresidence.org/)), do we need to flourish as a Smart City?

## Discovery phase feedback that led to this section

During and after the April 18, 2017 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked participants for advice through an [insights campaign](http://insights.austintexas.gov/Austin/1001/insights). We learned:

> "The City needs a better identified entryway to intake, evaluate, and provide feedback to specific solutions and technologies."

> "The City should consider and explore alternative finance models, including public-private partnerships."

> "The City needs a stronger capability for forming and managing public-private partnerships to address financing, risk, diversity, equity, and asset management."

> "Improvements to the City’s procurement process are critical to the success (and even initiation) of projects."

> "The City should value data as an asset in service delivery and partnerships in ways that: 1) respect intellectual property; 2) assess the cost of unauthorized disclosure; 3) address data ownership; and, 4) inform partnerships."

> "Contributors said the city needs to enable a state of readiness for agile and iterative implementation of projects."

## Challenge areas identified

* How might we provide a clear entryway to intake, evaluate, and provide feedback to proposed solutions and technologies?
* How might we intake and evaluate unsolicited proposals from vendors to the City?
* How might we evaluate where procurement processes hinder smart cities projects?
* How might we identify (legal) opportunities to test different approaches to procurement for smart cities projects?
* How might we influence changes in procurement processes that would enable greater success for smart cities projects?
