#### We want to be intentional and focused, so we request that you put forward concepts you or your organization have regarding one of the three focus areas mentioned above. To participate at the event, please: 

1. Review the problem frame you want to work on

2. Think of a concept –related to the problem frame– that you have been wanting to try for a while 

   *Hint: The right concept is something you have thought of before and said: “This could work!” Think of what will impact communities in the near-term future.*

3. Once you have decided on a concept, fill out this [form](https://airtable.com/shrEN0R3acNq3SEpd)

4. Come to the event on Nov. 12th ready to iterate on your concept and collaborate!
